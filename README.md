# Kedai Kopi Kenangan Senja

This repository serves as documentation for the development of the **Kedai Kopi Kenangan Senja** website. The project is based on and inspired by the work of Sandhika Galih, with some modifications and adaptations to suit specific requirements. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for those interested in learning about web development and interactive website features.

The **Kedai Kopi Kenangan Senja** website is designed to be an interactive experience, offering users an engaging way to explore the coffee shop's menu, services, and other features. While many functionalities have been implemented successfully, there is one key feature that remains **unfinished: Midtrans integration**. This payment gateway feature is a major milestone that has yet to be developed and is highlighted as an area for future improvement.

This repository is meant to serve as a guide and reference for developers looking to create similar interactive web experiences. Contributions such as bug fixes, feature improvements, or design enhancements are always welcome.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this project. If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
